# (En) XInput feedback Arduino 
Feedback for the keyboard and mouse. The library emulates the Xbox gamepad and sends a vibration signal to Arduino (pin 3). It does not work in all games and only for 32 bit games.

## Setup
Change the COM port number in the "Vibration.ini" file.


Copy the files "xinput1_3.dll" and "Vibration.ini" to the folder with the game. Perhaps for some games, you will have to rename "xinput1_3.dll" to one of the names: "xinput1_4.dll" (Windows 8 / metro apps only), "xinput1_2.dll", "xinput1_1.dll" or "xinput9_1_0.dll".

## Download
>Version for Windows XP, 7, 8.1, 10.
